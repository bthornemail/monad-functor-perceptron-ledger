# RFC XXXX: Geometric Consensus Protocol Using Universal Quadratic Forms

## Abstract

This specification defines a geometric consensus protocol that guarantees convergence within 14 steps using Ramanujan's universal quadratic forms. The protocol models distributed agreement as optimization in a Hilbert space of perceptron states, with automatic infinite-loop prevention through mathematical bounds.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Requirements Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

### 1.2. Protocol Overview

This protocol SHALL model consensus states as vectors in a 7-dimensional Hilbert space where:
- Basis vectors represent fundamental computational types
- Inner products measure state similarity
- Ramanujan's universal quadratic forms bound convergence
- Fano plane structures enable efficient coordination

## 2. Mathematical Foundation

### 2.1. Hilbert Space Requirements

Implementations SHALL model the consensus space as a complete Hilbert space H with:

```typescript
interface HilbertConsensusSpace {
  // REQUIRED basis vectors
  basis: [Node, Edge, Graph, Incidence, Hypergraph, Functor, Monad];
  
  // REQUIRED inner product measuring state similarity
  innerProduct(a: State, b: State): number {
    // MUST satisfy: positive definite, symmetric, linear
    return Σ hash_similarity(a[i], b[i]);
  }
  
  // MUST be complete (all Cauchy sequences converge)
  isComplete: true; // Proven via Fano lottery
}
```

### 2.2. Ramanujan Convergence Bound

Implementations SHALL guarantee convergence within 14 steps using Ramanujan's universal quadratic forms:

```typescript
// REQUIRED: Use Ramanujan forms for bounded convergence
class RamanujanConvergence {
  // MUST use these coefficient sets
  static UNIVERSAL_FORMS = [
    [1, 1, 2, 2], [1, 1, 2, 3], ..., [1, 1, 2, 14],
    [1, 2, 4, 4], [1, 2, 4, 5], ..., [1, 2, 4, 14]
  ];
  
  // MUST reject configurations requiring 15 steps
  static EXCEPTIONAL_FORM = [1, 2, 5, 5]; // Cannot represent 15
}
```

**Rationale**: Ramanujan (1917) proved these forms generate all positive integers with maximum coefficient 14, providing mathematical convergence bounds.

## 3. Core Protocol Specification

### 3.1. IPv6 Address Encoding

Implementations SHALL encode consensus parameters in IPv6 addresses as follows:

```
2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
│       │       │       │       │       │       │       │
└─Seg0  └─Seg1  └─Seg2  └─Seg3  └─Seg4  └─Seg5  └─Seg6  └─Seg7
Fano Pt1 Fano Pt2 Fano Pt3 Fano Pt4 Fano Pt5 Fano Pt6 Fano Pt7 Lottery+Shift
```

Where:
- Segments 0-6: MUST encode Fano plane structure (7 points)
- Segment 7: MUST encode geometric shift ±{0,1,2,3} and lottery result

### 3.2. Consensus Algorithm Requirements

```typescript
class GeometricConsensus {
  // REQUIRED: Achieve consensus within 14 steps
  async achieveConsensus(peers: Peer[]): Consensus {
    let state = this.initializeState();
    
    // MUST try Ramanujan forms in sequence
    for (let step = 1; step <= 14; step++) {
      const form = RamanujanConvergence.UNIVERSAL_FORMS[step - 1];
      state = this.applyQuadraticForm(state, form);
      
      if (this.consensusReached(state)) {
        return { valid: true, steps: step, state };
      }
    }
    
    // MUST reject if consensus not reached in 14 steps
    throw new ConsensusException("Maximum steps exceeded");
  }
  
  // REQUIRED: Use chromatic polynomial for validation
  private validateState(state: State): boolean {
    const chromatic = this.computeChromaticPolynomial(state);
    // π_G(-1) > 0 indicates acyclic (valid) configuration
    return chromatic.evaluate(-1) > 0;
  }
}
```

## 4. Geometric Structures Requirements

### 4.1. Self-Complementary Graphs as Monads

Implementations SHALL model monads as self-complementary graphs:

```typescript
// REQUIRED: Monad = Self-complementary graph
interface MonadAsGraph {
  // MUST satisfy G ≅ Ḡ (graph isomorphic to complement)
  isSelfComplementary: true;
  
  // SHOULD use known self-complementary graphs
  examples: ["P₂", "P₄", "C₅", "FanoPlane"];
}
```

### 4.2. Complement Transformations as Functors

Implementations SHALL model functors as complement transformations:

```typescript
// REQUIRED: Functor = Complement transformation  
interface FunctorAsComplement {
  // MUST implement F: G → Ḡ
  transform(graph: Graph): Graph {
    return graph.complement();
  }
  
  // MUST preserve categorical structure
  preservesComposition: true;
}
```

## 5. Implementation Requirements

### 5.1. Browser Execution

Implementations SHOULD support browser-native execution:

```typescript
// RECOMMENDED: Load models from IPv6 addresses
class BrowserModel {
  static async fromIPv6(ipv6: string): BrowserModel {
    // MUST decode geometric parameters from IPv6
    const geometry = IPv6Decoder.decode(ipv6);
    return new BrowserModel(geometry);
  }
}
```

### 5.2. Network Coordination

Implementations MUST support geometric partition detection:

```typescript
// REQUIRED: Detect partitions using Betti numbers
class PartitionDetector {
  detectPartition(network: Network): PartitionInfo {
    const bettiNumbers = this.computeBettiNumbers(network);
    // β₀ > 1 indicates partition
    return { isPartitioned: bettiNumbers.beta0 > 1 };
  }
}
```

## 6. Security Considerations

### 6.1. Cryptographic Requirements

Implementations MUST provide cryptographic sovereignty:

```typescript
// REQUIRED: Prove ownership of geometric structures
interface SovereigntyProof {
  // MUST include cryptographic signatures
  signature: CryptographicSignature;
  
  // MUST verify geometric structure preservation
  geometricProof: GeometricProof;
}
```

### 6.2. Byzantine Fault Protection

Implementations SHOULD use topological protection:

```typescript
// RECOMMENDED: Use index theorems for fault tolerance
class TopologicalProtection {
  // Index theorems provide topological invariants
  // Consensus outcomes cannot be changed by local perturbations
}
```

## 7. Performance Requirements

### 7.1. Convergence Bounds

Implementations MUST satisfy:
- Maximum consensus steps: 14
- Time complexity: O(1) in steps (bounded)
- Space complexity: O(n) in network size

### 7.2. Scalability

Implementations SHOULD support:
- Federated learning across multiple browsers
- P2P type synchronization without central coordination
- Cross-network geometric consensus

## 9. Appendix: Mathematical Proofs

### 9.1. 14-Step Convergence Proof

**Theorem**: Consensus converges within 14 steps.

**Proof**:
1. Ramanujan proved quadratic forms {1,1,2,d} with d≤14 are universal
2. Perceptron consensus reduces to quadratic optimization  
3. Therefore maximum steps = 14 (QED)

### 9.2. Infinite Loop Prevention Proof

**Theorem**: Protocol prevents infinite loops.

**Proof**:
1. Form {1,2,5,5} cannot represent 15 (Ramanujan exception)
2. 15th step would use exceptional form
3. System rejects configurations requiring 15 steps
4. Therefore no infinite loops (QED)
