## Geometric Consensus Protocol - Research Specification

This document provides a unified overview of the RFC XXXX research specification, exploring how geometric consensus, combinatorial designs, and categorical structures could form a protocol stack for distributed coordination.

## Overview

RFC XXXX proposes a **mathematical framework** where geometric shapes encode consensus thresholds, IPv6 addresses can specify system parameters, and combinatorial designs organize specifications. The system explores connections between pure mathematics (combinatorial design theory, projective geometry, algebraic topology) and distributed systems implementation to investigate geometric approaches to consensus and coordination.
