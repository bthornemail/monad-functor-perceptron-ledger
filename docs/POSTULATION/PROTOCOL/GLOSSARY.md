**Universal IP Basis**: Any IP address format (IP0, IP1, IP2, ...IPN) that can encode binary data structures using the same mathematical framework. The Universal IP Basis enables infinite extensibility with finite mathematical guarantees.

**Modular Arithmetic Encoding**: The mathematical operation `PATH.length / 7 = %5 ± {0,1,2,3}` that enables encoding of arbitrary data in any IP format. This operation MUST be implemented consistently across all IP levels.

**IP Level**: The specific IP address format being used (IP2, IP4, IP6, etc.). Each IP level maintains the same mathematical convergence guarantees while supporting different complexity levels.

**Convergence Bound**: The maximum number of steps required for mathematical convergence, which SHALL be 14 steps for all IP levels. This bound is derived from Ramanujan's Universal Quadratic Forms.
