## Abstract

This document extends RFC2119 for AI agent-specific keywords and defines protocols for autonomous agent coordination, sovereign identity, and federated learning within the POSTULATION framework. It specifies agent-to-agent communication protocols, coordination mechanisms, and learning protocols that enable AI agents to operate autonomously without central authority.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This specification defines protocols that enable AI agents to:
- Establish sovereign identities encoded in IP addresses
- Communicate directly without central servers
- Coordinate actions through distributed consensus
- Share knowledge through federated learning
- Adapt and evolve their capabilities autonomously

### 1.2 Scope

This specification covers:
- Agent identity generation and verification
- Inter-agent communication protocols
- Coordination and consensus mechanisms
- Capability discovery and advertisement
- Learning protocol integration
- Security and privacy preservation

## 2. Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

### 2.1 AI Agent-Specific Keywords

**MUST LEARN**: The agent is REQUIRED to learn from the specified data or experience.

**MUST NOT LEARN**: The agent is PROHIBITED from learning from the specified data or experience.

**SHALL ADAPT**: The agent is REQUIRED to adapt its behavior based on specified conditions.

**SHALL NOT ADAPT**: The agent is PROHIBITED from adapting its behavior in specified ways.

**SHOULD COORDINATE**: The agent is RECOMMENDED to coordinate with other agents for the specified purpose.

### 2.2 New Terms

**Sovereign Identity**: A cryptographically secure, persistent identity that an agent generates and controls autonomously.
