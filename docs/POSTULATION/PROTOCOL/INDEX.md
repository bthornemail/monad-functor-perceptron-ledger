# POSTULATION Protocol Documentation Index

## Overview

This directory contains RFC-style protocol specifications that extend the proven foundations of the MonadFunctorPerceptron protocol into new domains of AI agents, federated systems, and universal IP basis frameworks.

## Core Protocol Specifications

### [RFC-POSTULATION-universal-ip-basis.md](./RFC-POSTULATION-universal-ip-basis.md)
**Status**: Draft  
**Abstract**: Defines the Universal IP Basis Framework enabling any binary data structure to be encoded in any IP address format (IP0-IPN) using modular arithmetic. This is the foundational innovation that enables all other postulations.

**Key Concepts**:
- Modular arithmetic: `PATH.length / 7 = %5 ¬± {0,1,2,3}`
- Mathematical equivalence across IP levels
- Flexible type system with optional components
- Universal binary transformation

### [RFC-POSTULATION-ai-agents.md](./RFC-POSTULATION-ai-agents.md)
**Status**: Draft  
**Abstract**: Extends RFC2119 for AI agent-specific keywords and defines protocols for autonomous agent coordination, sovereign identity, and federated learning.

**Key Concepts**:
- Sovereign identity protocols
- Agent-to-agent communication
- Federated learning coordination
- Cross-platform agent compatibility

### [RFC-POSTULATION-federated-systems.md](./RFC-POSTULATION-federated-systems.md)
**Status**: Draft  
**Abstract**: Defines protocols for decentralized social-economic systems, governance mechanisms, and economic coordination without central authority.

**Key Concepts**:
- Decentralized governance protocols
- Economic coordination mechanisms
- Social coordination without central platforms
- UDP/HTTP3 binary handshakes

### [RFC-POSTULATION-decentralized-training.md](./RFC-POSTULATION-decentralized-training.md)
**Status**: Draft  
**Abstract**: Specifies protocols for cross-platform, cross-spectrum binary feature embedding and decentralized model training with multithreading coordination.

**Key Concepts**:
- Cross-platform feature embedding
- Decentralized model training
- Multithreading coordination
- Federated provenance proximity

## Supporting Documentation

### [IANA-CONSIDERATIONS.md](./IANA-CONSIDERATIONS.md)
**Status**: Draft  
**Abstract**: Internet Assigned Numbers Authority considerations for new protocol parameters, port assignments, and registry requirements.

### [GLOSSARY.md](./GLOSSARY.md)
**Status**: Draft  
**Abstract**: Comprehensive glossary of terms, concepts, and mathematical notation used throughout the POSTULATION protocol specifications.
