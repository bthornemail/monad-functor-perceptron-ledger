**Document**: RFC-POSTULATION-universal-ip-basis  
**Status**: Draft  
**Date**: 2024-01-XX  
**Author**: [Author Name]  
**Category**: Standards Track  

## Abstract

This document defines the Universal IP Basis Framework, extending the proven IPv6 quantum computational living physics simulation protocol to arbitrary IP address formats (IP0, IP1, IP2, IP3, IP4, IP5, IP6, IP7, ...IPN). The framework demonstrates that any binary data structure SHALL be encoded in any IP address format using modular arithmetic while maintaining the same mathematical convergence guarantees established for IPv6.

The Universal IP Basis Framework enables infinite extensibility with finite mathematical guarantees, allowing implementations to scale from minimal IP2 systems to fully extensible IPN systems while preserving the 14-step convergence bound derived from Ramanujan's Universal Quadratic Forms.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

The Geometric Consensus Protocol, as specified in RFC-DRAFT-ipv6-quantum-basis, establishes IPv6 addresses as a universal computational basis for quantum computational living physics simulation. This protocol has been mathematically proven to guarantee convergence within 14 steps using Ramanujan's Universal Quadratic Forms and the Fano Plane lottery mechanism.

However, the mathematical foundations underlying this protocol are not specific to IPv6's 128-bit address space. The core geometric structures, convergence guarantees, and cryptographic properties SHALL be extended to any IP address format using modular arithmetic.

### 1.2 Motivation

The Universal IP Basis Framework addresses several key requirements:

1. **Scalability**: Implementations MUST be able to scale from minimal embedded systems (IP2) to fully extensible cloud systems (IPN)
2. **Flexibility**: Different complexity levels SHOULD be supported without requiring full hypergraph block design structures
3. **Mathematical Consistency**: The same convergence guarantees MUST be maintained across all IP levels
4. **Universal Compatibility**: Cross-platform and cross-protocol interoperability SHALL be enabled

### 1.3 Scope

This specification defines:
- Mathematical foundations for universal IP basis encoding
- Modular arithmetic for path length collapse
- Flexible type system with optional components
- Convergence guarantees across all IP levels
- Implementation guidelines for different IP levels

## 2. Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

### 2.1 New Terms

**Universal IP Basis**: Any IP address format (IP0, IP1, IP2, ...IPN) that can encode binary data structures using the same mathematical framework.

**Modular Arithmetic Encoding**: The mathematical operation `PATH.length / 7 = %5 ± {0,1,2,3}` that enables encoding of arbitrary data in any IP format.

**IP Level**: The specific IP address format being used (IP2, IP4, IP6, etc.).

**Convergence Bound**: The maximum number of steps required for mathematical convergence, which SHALL be 14 steps for all IP levels.

## 3. Universal IP Basis Framework

### 3.1 Mathematical Foundation

The Universal IP Basis Framework is based on the mathematical principle that any binary data structure can be encoded in any IP address format using modular arithmetic. The core mathematical operation is:

```

```

This operation MUST be implemented consistently across all IP levels to ensure mathematical equivalence.
