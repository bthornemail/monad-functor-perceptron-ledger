**How Geometric Consensus Works:**
1. **Proposal**: A participant proposes a change
2. **Encoding**: The proposal is encoded using geometric structures
3. **Distribution**: The encoded proposal is shared with all participants
4. **Voting**: Participants vote on the proposal using geometric operations
5. **Aggregation**: Votes are aggregated using mathematical functions
6. **Convergence**: The process converges to a final decision
7. **Execution**: The agreed-upon change is implemented

**Mathematical Guarantees:**
- **Convergence**: Process always reaches a decision
- **Consistency**: All participants have the same final state
- **Security**: Process is resistant to malicious participants
- **Efficiency**: Process completes in reasonable time

**Example:**
Think of geometric consensus like a voting system:
- Instead of simple yes/no votes, participants use geometric shapes
- The shapes are combined using mathematical operations
- The final result is guaranteed to be consistent and secure
