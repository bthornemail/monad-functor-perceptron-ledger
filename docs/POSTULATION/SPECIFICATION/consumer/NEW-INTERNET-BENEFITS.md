## What is the New Internet?

The new internet is like upgrading from a basic phone to a smartphone - it's the same basic concept, but with amazing new capabilities that make everything better, faster, and more secure.

### Think of it Like This:

**Old Internet**: Like a library where you can only read books that the librarian chooses for you
**New Internet**: Like having your own personal library where you control what books are available, who can read them, and how they're organized

- You can earn money from your own data if you choose to share it

**Real Example:**
Instead of Facebook owning all your photos and posts, you would own them. You could choose to share them with friends, sell them to advertisers (if you want), or keep them completely private.
