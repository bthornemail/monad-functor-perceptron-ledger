## 1. Getting Started

### 1.1 Prerequisites

Before starting these exercises, you should have:

## 2. Exercise 1: Understanding IPv6 Addresses

### 2.1 Learning Objectives

By the end of this exercise, you will:
- Understand the structure of IPv6 addresses
- Be able to convert between different formats
- Recognize the 8-segment structure used by the protocol

### 2.2 Background Information

IPv6 addresses are 128-bit numbers written in hexadecimal format. They look like this:
```
2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
```

The protocol treats these addresses as 8 segments of 16 bits each:
- Segment 0: `2001` (16 bits)
- Segment 1: `0db8` (16 bits)
- Segment 2: `85a3` (16 bits)
- Segment 3: `0000` (16 bits)
- Segment 4: `0000` (16 bits)
- Segment 5: `8a2e` (16 bits)
- Segment 6: `0370` (16 bits)
- Segment 7: `7334` (16 bits)

### 2.3 Exercise Tasks

**Task 1: Address Parsing**
1. Take the IPv6 address: `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`
2. Write down each segment and its decimal value
3. Convert each segment to binary
4. Verify that each segment is exactly 16 bits

**Task 2: Address Generation**
1. Generate 5 random IPv6 addresses
2. For each address, identify the 8 segments
3. Calculate the decimal value of each segment
4. Verify that all segments are between 0 and 65535

**Task 3: Address Comparison**
1. Take two IPv6 addresses: `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334` and `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7335`
2. Compare them segment by segment
3. Identify which segments match and which don't
4. Calculate the "similarity score" (number of matching segments)

### 2.4 Expected Results

**Task 1 Results:**
- Segment 0: `2001` = 8193 (decimal) = `0010000000000001` (binary)
- Segment 1: `0db8` = 3512 (decimal) = `0000110110111000` (binary)
- Segment 2: `85a3` = 34211 (decimal) = `1000010110100011` (binary)
- Segment 3: `0000` = 0 (decimal) = `0000000000000000` (binary)
- Segment 4: `0000` = 0 (decimal) = `0000000000000000` (binary)
- Segment 5: `8a2e` = 35374 (decimal) = `1000101000101110` (binary)
- Segment 6: `0370` = 880 (decimal) = `0000001101110000` (binary)
- Segment 7: `7334` = 29492 (decimal) = `0111001100110100` (binary)

**Task 2 Results:**
Your generated addresses should have 8 segments each, with each segment being a valid 16-bit number.

**Task 3 Results:**
- Matching segments: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (7 out of 8)

Consensus is the process of getting multiple systems to agree on something. The protocol uses mathematical guarantees to ensure consensus will always complete within 14 steps.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Initial State**: Each system starts with its own IPv6 address
- **Consensus Process**: Systems exchange information and update their addresses

### 4.4 Expected Results

**Task 1 Results:**
- Step 1: A=`2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`, B=`2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7335`

- Consensus reached in 2 steps

**Task 2 Results:**
- Consensus should complete within 14 steps
- Final agreement should be consistent across all systems
- Convergence time may vary based on starting conditions

**Task 3 Results:**
- Consensus should still complete within 14 steps
- Final agreement should be consistent
- More systems may require more steps but still within the guarantee

    # Split by colons
    segments = ipv6_string.split(':')
    
    # Ensure we have exactly 8 segments
    if len(segments) != 8:
        raise ValueError("IPv6 address must have exactly 8 segments")
    
    # Convert each segment to integer
    result = []
    for segment in segments:
        try:
            value = int(segment, 16)
            if value < 0 or value > 65535:
                raise ValueError(f"Segment {segment} is out of range")
            result.append(value)

    segments = []
    for _ in range(8):
        segment = random.randint(0, 65535)
        segments.append(segment)

    matches = 0
    for i in range(8):
        if addr1[i] == addr2[i]:
            matches += 1
    
    return matches / 8

        for (let i = 0; i < steps; i++) {
            const last = result.pop();
            result.unshift(last);
        }
        return result;
    }
    
    scale(address, factor) {
        // Scale each segment by the factor
        return address.map(segment => {
            const scaled = Math.round(segment * factor);
            return Math.min(scaled, this.maxSegment);
        });
    }
    
    translate(address, offset) {
        // Add offset to each segment
        return address.map(segment => {
            const translated = segment + offset;
            return Math.min(translated, this.maxSegment);
        });
    }
    
    reflect(address) {
        // Reverse the order of segments
        return [...address].reverse();
    }
}

// Test the operations
const ops = new IPv6GeometricOperations();
const testAddress = [8193, 3512, 34211, 0, 0, 35374, 880, 29492];

console.log("Original:", testAddress);
console.log("Rotated:", ops.rotate(testAddress, 1));
console.log("Scaled:", ops.scale(testAddress, 2));
console.log("Translated:", ops.translate(testAddress, 1000));
