# RFC XXXX - Extended Keywords Protocol (Extending RFC2119)

**Status:** Draft  
**Category:** Standards Track  
**Date:** 2024-01-XX  
**Author:** [Your Name]  
**Abstract:** This RFC extends RFC2119 to define additional keywords for quantum computational protocols, enabling precise specification of requirements for entities supporting basic programming constructs in distributed quantum computational systems.

## 1. Introduction

RFC2119 defines key words for use in RFCs to indicate requirement levels. This RFC extends those keywords to support quantum computational protocols where entities must support basic programming constructs: `call`, `async`, `await`, `try`, and `catch`.

### 1.1 Motivation

Traditional RFC2119 keywords (MUST, SHOULD, MAY) are insufficient for quantum computational protocols that require:
- Quantum state management
- Asynchronous operation handling
- Error recovery mechanisms
- Sovereign identity verification
- Universal binary transformation

### 1.2 Scope

This extension applies to protocols involving:
- Quantum computational entities
- IPv6 basis transformations
- Sovereign persistent identities
- Universal binary processing
- Distributed decision trees

## 2. Extended Keywords

### 2.1 Quantum Computational Keywords

**QUANTUM** - Indicates a requirement that MUST be implemented using quantum computational principles:
- Superposition encoding
- Entanglement protocols
- Interference patterns
- Measurement collapse

**BASIS** - Indicates a requirement that MUST use IPv6 format as computational basis:
- 8-segment structure
- Geometric transformations
- Universal constants (φ, π, ψ)
- Eigenvector encoding

**SOVEREIGN** - Indicates a requirement for sovereign identity:
- IPv6-based identity
- Cryptographic verification
- No central authority
- Persistent ownership

### 2.2 Programming Construct Keywords

**CALL** - Indicates a requirement that MUST support synchronous function invocation:
```typescript
// MUST implement call() method
async call(operation: string): Promise<Result>
```

**ASYNC** - Indicates a requirement that MUST support asynchronous operation initiation:
```typescript
// MUST implement async operation support
async async(operation: string): Promise<OperationId>
```

**AWAIT** - Indicates a requirement that MUST support asynchronous operation completion:
```typescript
// MUST implement await operation support
async await(operationId: OperationId): Promise<Result>
```

**TRY** - Indicates a requirement that MUST support error handling initiation:
```typescript
// MUST implement try block support
try {
  // operation
} catch (error) {
  // error handling
}
```

**CATCH** - Indicates a requirement that MUST support error handling completion:
```typescript
// MUST implement catch block support
catch (error: Error): Promise<ErrorResult>
```

### 2.3 Mathematical Guarantee Keywords

**CONVERGE** - Indicates a requirement that MUST guarantee mathematical convergence:
- Ramanujan's 14-step bound
- Fano plane lottery guarantee
- Geometric convergence proof
- Finite decision tree depth

**TRANSFORM** - Indicates a requirement that MUST support universal transformation:
- Any binary data → IPv6 basis
- IPv6 basis → any binary data
- Geometric operations
- Universal constants

**VERIFY** - Indicates a requirement that MUST provide verification mechanisms:
- Identity verification
- State validation
- Cryptographic proof
- Quantum signature

## 3. Implementation Requirements
