## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) considerations for the IPv6 Quantum Basis Protocol. It identifies any new registrations, assignments, or modifications to existing IANA registries that may be required.

## 2. IPv6 Address Space Usage

### 2.1 Current IPv6 Allocation

The IPv6 Quantum Basis Protocol uses existing IPv6 address space as defined in RFC 4291. No new IPv6 address allocations are required.

### 2.2 Address Format Usage

The protocol uses the standard IPv6 address format:
- 8 segments of 16 bits each (128 bits total)
- Standard hexadecimal notation (e.g., 2001:db8::1)
- No modifications to existing IPv6 address structure

### 2.3 Special Address Ranges

The protocol does not require any special IPv6 address ranges or reserved addresses beyond those already defined in RFC 4291.

## 3. Protocol Numbers

### 3.1 Next Header Values

The protocol does not introduce new Next Header values. It operates at the application layer and can use existing transport protocols (TCP, UDP, etc.).

### 3.2 Port Numbers

No new well-known port numbers are required. The protocol can operate on any available port numbers as configured by implementations.

## 4. Registry Considerations

### 4.1 No New Registries Required

The IPv6 Quantum Basis Protocol does not require the creation of new IANA registries. All necessary identifiers and parameters are derived from existing IPv6 address space and standard cryptographic primitives.

### 4.2 Existing Registry Usage

The protocol may reference existing IANA registries for:
- Cryptographic algorithm identifiers (if applicable)
- Standard protocol numbers (for transport layer)
- Standard port numbers (for service identification)

## 5. Security Considerations

### 5.1 Cryptographic Identifiers

The protocol uses standard cryptographic algorithms and does not require new cryptographic algorithm identifiers in IANA registries.

### 5.2 Key Management

Sovereign identity generation uses standard cryptographic key generation methods without requiring new IANA key management protocols.

## 6. Implementation Considerations

### 6.1 Backward Compatibility

The protocol is designed to be backward compatible with existing IPv6 implementations and does not require modifications to existing IPv6 infrastructure.

### 6.2 Forward Compatibility

The protocol design allows for future extensions without requiring changes to IANA registries or address space allocations.

## 7. Conclusion

The IPv6 Quantum Basis Protocol does not require any new IANA registrations, assignments, or modifications to existing registries. The protocol operates entirely within the existing IPv6 address space and uses standard cryptographic and networking primitives.
